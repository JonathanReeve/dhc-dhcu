title: A Brief History of Digital Humanities at Columbia University
permalink: /history/

Columbia was one of the early of pioneers of digital humanities starting in the 1950s even before this mode of inquiry became known as Humanities Computing. Jessica Hellwig, of the Columbia Computer Center (CUCC), developed early concordance tools for use in the humanities. Columbia educated and professor at Teachers College, Louis T. Milic’s work "A Quantitative Approach to the Style of Jonathan Swift" was among the first study to use computer analysis in the humanities. Today, Jacques Barzun is remembered as University Professor, dean and provost, but it should also be noted that since the early days of computing in the humanities he was involved in the conversation. At the important 1956 Yale conference sponsored by IBM on "Computers for the Humanities," Barzun organized the panel, "Man and the Machine," where he prefigured many of the intellectual problems that still haunt and inspire the digital humanities today. In 1958, The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (CPEMC) was founded by Professors Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. 

These scholars and pioneers were not the only ones thinking about these issues at Columbia, though. Throughout the decades, Columbia researchers contributed to important journals in the field of humanities computing, including notable interventions in the historically important [Computers and the Humanities](http://www.jstor.org/journal/comphuma) (1966-1994). The scholarship grew in tandem with the growth in computing at Columbia in general. That history is well documented in Frank da Cruz's comprehensive  article, "[Columbia University Computing History](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/)."


The story of the digital humanities at Columbia can neither be told without highlighting the important role the libraries have played over the past few decades. Library automation began in 1967, with enormous consequences for the future of humanities research at Columbia. In 1988, Columbia's furthered its commitment to humanities computing by becoming the first research library to provide an Electronic Text Service for researchers interested in utilizing digital texts and technology tools in their scholarship. Beginning as a small by-appointment center serving a couple of hundred users a year, the Electronic Text Service—now known as the Digital Humanities Center—has grown exponentially to a walk-in facility serving more than 12,000 patrons each year. The Digital Humanities Center (DHC) has historically included broad support for patron digitization, and text and multimedia editing and analysis needs, but the staff of the DHC also foster more ambitious project work. The department’s facilities and staff contributed substantially to the production of such major work as Eric Foner’s Story of American Freedom, Anders Winroth’s Making of Gratian’s Decretum, Michael Zakim’s Ready-Made Democracy: a history of men’s dress in the American republic, 1760-1860, and James Delbourgo’s A Most Amazing Scene of Wonders: electricity and enlightenment in early America, as well as of countless other graduate, undergraduate, librarian and faculty research projects. The DHC has also partnered with researchers on a number of desktop and online projects with major publishers of full-text databases. Those close vendor contacts have enabled recent  successful negotiations with publishers for broader and deeper access to content for individual faculty research. In the last decade, under the stewardship of Bob Scott, our Digital Humanities Librarian, the DHC has partnered with faculty and students across a range of humanities disciplines.

In addition to the DHC, four other units in the Library have contributed significantly to digital scholarship and pedagogy on campus in the humanities - the Libraries Digital Program Division (LDPD), the The Digital Social Science Center, the former Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL)—which formed part of the library until it transformed into the current Center for Teaching and Learning, and the Center for Digital Research and Scholarship (CDRS). LDPD was created in the Libraries in 2002 to further three important areas for digital scholarship: collection-based digitization; long-term digital preservation; and the Libraries websites. The long-term digital preservation aim of this department is crucial to the Libraries efforts in the digital humanities. Since 1999 CCNMTL, now CTL, has been committed to enhancing teaching and learning through the purposeful use of new media and technology. In partnership with faculty, CCNMTL/CTL has supported efforts ranging from basic course website management to project development for humanities courses. CDRS, created in 2007, has worked with faculty, students and staff to increase the utility and impact of their research and scholarship.

During the last decade we also see the formation of teams within the Schools that have either focused on or have produced projects in digital humanities.

The latest chapter of digital humanities is characterized by increased collaboration across departments, teams and divisions, with a visible increase in production. With the foundation of the Butler Library Studio in 2013—a space specifically designed to bring together faculty, students, librarians and staff around digital humanities and digital pedagogy—we see a new door open up for Digital Humanities at Columbia. Originally envisioned by Alex Gil, Mark Phillipson and Barbara Rockenbach in close collaboration with Dennis Tenen and Manan Ahmed, the space has become a central meeting place for teams across the university to collaborate, teach, learn, and research around the use of computation in the humanities.  

Soon after opening the doors to the new space in Butler Library, Gil (Libraries), Tenen (English & Comp. Lit.) and Ahmed (History) formed the [Group for Experimental in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) as a research collective based at the Studio. Focusing on a broad range of critical and experimental approaches to research and making in the digital humanities, the *xpmethod* group has become a locus of avant-garde production and advanced graduate, library and faculty work—already garnering national and international recognition. Today, the Studio continues to be a site for innovative research collaboration across disciplines and teams, hosting a vibrant series of talks, events, workshops, and open labs.

We hope that our bountiful history, together with the wonderful work of the people and teams showcased here will continue to inspire all of us as we steward our broader humanities work well into the twenty-first century.
