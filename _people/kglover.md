Having received a B.A. in French History and Literature and Afro-American Studies from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in French and Romance Philology from Columbia University, Professor Glover joined the faculty in 2002. Her teaching and research interests include francophone literature, particularly that of Haiti and the French Antilles; colonialism and postcolonialism; and sub-Saharan francophone African cinema. She advises students in French, Africana Studies, Comparative Literature, and Human Rights. Her book, Haiti Unbound: A Spiralist Challenge to the Postcolonial Canon (Liverpool UP 2010), addresses the general issue of canon formation in the francophone Caribbean and the particular fate of the Haitian Spiralist authors vis-à-vis this canon. She has published articles in The French Review, Small Axe, Research in African Literatures, The Journal of Postcolonial Writings, and The Journal of Haitian Studies, among others, and is currently at work on a project that addresses literary representations of self-care in Caribbean prose fiction as ethical practices for women living in coercive communities. She is the co-editor of New Narratives of Haiti, a special issue of Transition magazine; co-editor of Translating the Caribbean, a volume of critical essays on translation in the Americas published as a two-part special section of Small Axe; first editor of Revisiting Marie Vieux Chauvet: Paradoxes of the Postcolonial Feminine, a volume of critical essays forthcoming as a special issue of Yale French Studies; and co-editor of the forthcoming Duke University Press Haiti Reader. She has translated Frankétienne’s Mûr à crever (Ready to Burst) and René Depestre's Hadriana dans tous mes rêves (Hadriana in All My Dreams), and her translation of Chauvet’s Danse sur le volcan (Dance on the Volcano) is forthcoming in 2016. She has been on the editorial board of the Romanic Review since 2002, on the editorial board of Small Axe since 2012, is a founder and co-coordinator of the Transnational and Transcolonial Caribbean Studies Research Group, and is a contributor to The New York Times Book Review. Professor Glover has been the recipient of fellowships and awards from the Fulbright Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, The New York Public Library, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
