Phillip R. Polefrone is a PhD candidate in Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature, working on the digital humanities, 20th-century American fiction, and ecocriticism. His current work combines literary mapping and natural language processing, using semi-automated location extraction and georeferencing to examine distributions of literary locations across large corpora of texts. Previous projects include: semantic analysis of one million "Gamergate" tweets; and "Roget Tools," a semantic analysis tool using the word category hierarchies in Roget's Thesaurus to look for semantic patterns and correlations.
