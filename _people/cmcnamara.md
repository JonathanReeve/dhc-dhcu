Charley McNamara studies the notion of forensic certainty in antiquity and its afterlife in early modern Italy, and his interests include the rhetorical tradition, ancient philosophy, and ancient education. He is a Preceptor in Contemporary Civilization in Columbia's Core Curriculum,
and he also regularly teaches with the Paideia Institute, a non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the study and appreciation of the classical humanities. He serves as the Section Editor for Classics at the Open Library of Humanities, an open-access, peer-reviewed mega-journal for humanities scholarship, and he is co-editing a forthcoming volume on ambiguity in Latin literature (Brill, 2016). Before beginning his graduate studies at Columbia, he taught high school English in rural Arkansas with Teach for America. He holds a B.A. from Harvard College.

McNamara also serves as the Section Editor for Classics at the Open Library of Humanities, an open-access, peer-reviewed mega-journal for humanities scholarship. His latest digital project is creating a collection of collaborative digital editions of Renaissance Latin texts at <a href="http://gitclassics.github.io">GitClassics</a>.
