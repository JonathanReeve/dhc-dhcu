Charles McNamara is a Preceptor in Contemporary Civilization and Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Classics. His dissertation research explores the notion of forensic certainty in antiquity and its afterlife in Early Modern Italy, and he is interested more generally in the rhetorical tradition, ancient philosophy, and ancient education. He also regularly teaches with the Paideia Institute, a non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the study and appreciation of the classical humanities. He serves as the Section Editor for Classics at the Open Library of Humanities, an open-access, peer-reviewed mega-journal for humanities scholarship. His latest digital project is creating a collection of collaborative digital editions of Renaissance Latin texts at <a href="http://gitclassics.github.io">GitClassics</a>.
