Aaron works on the history of computation, with particular emphasis on how machine learning has been used to classify individuals, construct identity, imagine communities, and legislate forms of social, scientific, and political evidence. His current project explores how material circumstances, cultural assumptions, and technological contingency have shaped benchmark data sets in ways that perpetuate systemic inequality. This past summer he worked as a research intern at MSR-NYC and as a research lead for the AI Now symposium, the results of which were incorporated into a summary and recommendation report, produced at the behest of the White House, examining the social and economic implications of artificial intelligence. 

Prior to living in New York Aaron taught courses in literature and writing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Colorado State University, Benedictine University, and elsewhere. During this time he also curated a variety of creative projects and interdisciplinary collaborations, including Stars are Symbols and the No Perch Reading Series. His poetry has appeared in Diagram, Juked, Alice Blue, Requited, > Kill Author, and elsewhere. 

A doctoral student in History at Columbia University, Aaron holds a BS in Physics and Astronomy and a BA in English Writing from Drake University, an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and an MA in Humanities and Social Thought from New York University.
