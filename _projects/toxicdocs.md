[Toxic Docs](toxicdocs.org) is a database of millions of previously classified documents on industrial poisons (and Counting). The digital archive was developed from a large cache of primary documents that were used as evidence or collected during the “discovery” phase of various trials—many of which Dr. Rosner and Markowitz were involved. The records, minutes, memos and letters of companies that produced or used lead , vinyl, asbestos, PCBs, and other toxic materials are included in the database.
