Part of the <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/theory-method/medieval-mapping.html">Mapping Medieval Pasts</a> series by Manan Ahmed, "<a href="http://emilyfuhrman.co/x/F2015002_CU_BORDERLANDS_MEDIEVAL-MAPPING/">Delivering post by foot in medieval India</a>" depicts the known and extrapolated range of a 9th century postal route across medieval north India, as described in <i>Arabic Classical Accounts of India and China</i>, "Book I: Roads and Kingdoms" <sup><a href="http://emilyfuhrman.co/x/F2015002_CU_BORDERLANDS_MEDIEVAL-MAPPING/#1">[1]</a></sup>. By incorporating the distances listed in the text as well as the terrain of the traveled region, it seeks to account for the probable span one could cover on foot in the context of the described path.
